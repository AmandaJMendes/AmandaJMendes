I am an undergradutate student in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG) and I have a technical degree in Industrial Automation from the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS).

In addition to formal education, I continuously seek qualification through online courses as well as engangement with projects. For four years of the technical course, I developed software in research projects, which aroused my interst for fields like artificial inteligence and data science. Currently, in the university, I work with research and development of deep learning models for ASTRAL project (https://www.astral-project.eu/) .

Finally, I am really passionate about technological innovation and research, especially when it comes to artificial inteligence. I consider myself a very motivated person, with good communication skills, strong will to learn and with an open mind for new opportunities and experiences.
