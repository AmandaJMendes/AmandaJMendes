I am an undergradutate student in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG) and I have a technical degree in Industrial Automation from the Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS).

In addition to formal education, I continuously seek qualification through online courses as well as engangement with projects. For four years of the technical course, I developed software in research projects, which aroused my interst for fields like artificial inteligence and data science. Currently, in the university, I work with research and development of deep learning models for ASTRAL project (https://www.astral-project.eu/).

I am really passionate about technological innovation and research, especially when it comes to artificial inteligence. I consider myself a very motivated person, with good communication skills, strong will to learn and with an open mind for new opportunities and experiences. 

Well, by now you know a bit of who I am as a student and as a developer. However, I truly believe that trying to define people by what they've achieved is kinda tricky. In my opinion, understanding the whys and hows is as important as readind results and accomplishments in a resume. So... Who am I? In a nutshell, I'm an outgoing person born and raised in a 200,000 inhabitants city in the south of the south of Brazil. I've always stood out as a student, I believe not only because I'm a fast learner but also because of my determination, discipline and proactivity. Also, some people think this is weird (I don't judge them ðŸ˜„), but I've always genuinely enjoyed studing. 

When I was about 7 years old, my cousing/older sis decided to leave town (by the way, this was huge considering that my whole familly lives within a 5 minutes' ride from my home). After a while, I started reading science fiction books. I know it may seem nonsense, but this was really a turning point in my life. My cousing moving away and books showing me that life could have a true meaning (didn't expect the meaning to be 42, but Douglas Adams has poetic liscence, right?) made me realize that the world was big, and wonderful, and full of possibilities. So this is who I am, a young woman who loves traveling and discovering new things, who is trying to make the most out of life, trying to improve myself as a person and as a student/professional, just being happy, following my dreams and doing/studing/reseaching/developing what I love.   

Finally, if you are intersted in my academic experiences (projects, courses, etc) here is the link to my LinkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-mendes-2aa694197 and you can check my repositories too. Also, if you like, you can reach me by e-mail (amanda7rg@hotmail.com).
